# Multiple Choice Quiz with Timer
Topic: How well do you know the avengers?

10 question multiple choice quiz with 4 answer choices per question. Implemented a countdown timer that starts at 90 seconds, but will count down 8 seconds faster if the users answer incorrectly. The progress bar will fill up as the users progress through the quiz. If users answer questions correctly their choice will turn green, if answered incorrectly their choice will turn red. The quiz has a score counter that counts up by 10 everytime the user answers a question correctly. If users do not answer all 10 questions before the 90 second timer runs out, then they get rerouted to the home page. If users are able to answer all ten questions in the 90 seconds allowed, the program will prompt users to enter their name into a highscore page. The high score page allows up to 20 user names to be stored.
